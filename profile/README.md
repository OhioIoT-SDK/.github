# OhioIoT SDK

Working device starting points designed to get you connected quickly and ready to build on.

These repositories provide practical starter firmware for devices connecting to the OhioIoT platform. The goal is simple:

Get something working fast.  
Understand it clearly.  
Build on top of it.

## What This Is

These are structured starting points — not throwaway examples and not overengineered frameworks.

Each starter is designed to:

- Connect reliably
- Stay readable
- Be easy to extend
- Scale when you're ready

## Status

Repositories are currently under development.

More details and documentation will be added as projects become publicly available.
